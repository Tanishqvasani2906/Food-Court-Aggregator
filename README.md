# Food-Court-Aggregator
Description about the Project:
The aim of this project is to design and develop a software system that aggregates the information and services of different food courts on the university campus. The software system will allow students, staff and visitors to browse, compare and order food from various vendors, as well as provide feedback and ratings. The software system will also enable the food court operators to manage their inventory, menus, prices and promotions. The software system will be implemented using web and mobile technologies, and will follow the principles of usability, security and scalability.
